""" import os
print(os.name)
 """

#if we want to import only a specific function or defination keyword `from` 

""" from os import name
print(name) """

# the from keyword also allows us to import the whole  using asterisk symbol(*)

""" from os import*
print(name) """

# ,however this is bad practice...can lead to misleading.
